# Neural Networks for Thyroid Disease Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of thyroid disease using neural networks. It includes implementations in both MATLAB and Python (using Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs). The goal is to analyze and classify thyroid function based on medical data.

## Features:

Implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network in MATLAB.

A CNN model implemented in Python for thyroid classification.

Preprocessed thyroid dataset for training and evaluation.

Documentation and scripts for data handling and model training.

### Dataset Information

The project uses a thyroid dataset containing medical parameters related to thyroid function. The dataset files included are:

thyroidDF_cleaned.csv: A preprocessed version of the dataset.

thyroidDF.csv: The raw dataset used for training and evaluation.

Each row in the dataset represents a patient's medical record, with various numerical and categorical features indicating thyroid function. The target variable indicates whether the patient has normal thyroid function, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism.

# Neural Networks for Thyroid Disease Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of thyroid disease using neural networks. It includes implementations in both MATLAB and Python (using several archtiectures). The goal is to analyze and classify thyroid deseases based on medical data using different models, in order to fined the most effective one.

## Features:

Implementation of a Feed-Forward Neural Network in MATLAB.

A Feed-Forward, a Convolutional, a Recurrent, and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network implemented in Python for thyroid classification.

Preprocessed thyroid dataset for training and evaluation.

Documentation and scripts for data handling and model training.

### Dataset Information

The project uses a thyroid dataset containing medical parameters related to thyroid function. The dataset files included are:

thyroidDF_cleaned.csv: A preprocessed version of the dataset.

thyroidDF.csv: The raw dataset used for training and evaluation.

Each row in the dataset represents a patient's medical record, with various numerical and categorical features indicating thyroid function. The target variable indicates whether the patient has normal thyroid function, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism.
